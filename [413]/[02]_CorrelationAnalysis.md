## Estimator:
> Assume X,Y are two normal random variables. Knowning that the joint distribution is bivariate normal. Then using MLE to estimate the coefficient wil be Sxy/sqrt(Sxx*Syy). It turns out that the distribution of the estimatetor of coefficient is complex. Fisher suggested a transformation of coefficient which is asymtotically standard normal when n is large (CLT).

## Comapre to Beta 1 (slope):
The coefficient of correlation is a measure of the strength of the linear association between Y and X. 
It will always be the same sign as the slope estimatetor Beta1. However, it has several advantage different from Beta1.

- If we are not sure about the predicted and responsed variable ( not sure about whether y depends on x or x depends on y ), then we would like to use the correlation to analyze the relationship between them. 

- Beta1 ( slope ) depends on the unit of x and y, but coefficinnt doesn't

- The range of coefficient is [-1,1]

- * it is only useful to measure the linear association between x an y by the defination of correlation. Therefore, not useful to measur the nonlinear association!)
