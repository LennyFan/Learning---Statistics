- Correlation 
- normality (QQ)

## Constancy of Variance
- Brown-Forsythe test:

Partition observations x_i into several groups, corresponding to observations with different values. ( basic ANOVA test !! ) 
Comparing the variance between the group and the vriance withing the group. If we only partition into two groups we can use t-test.
