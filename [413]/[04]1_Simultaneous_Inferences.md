#### Bonferroni Correction

It provides a very conservative upper/lower bound. Similarly, if there is a large number of joint confidence intervals, then the individual confidence intervals are (much) larger than usual.

For example, let β1 and β0 be two parameters. Then a joint confidence region of size at least 1 − α for (β1, β0) can be obtained by combining a confidence interval of size 1 − α/2 for β0 with another confidence interval of size 1 − α/2 for β1. We can use Bonferroni Correction when we want to compute

- (joint) significance level for a family of hypotheses tests

- (joint) confidence region for a family of confidence intervals
